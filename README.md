# Smart Contract (Solidity) ⛓️

### 🔧 What It Does:

- Stores donation logic
- Manages who gets how much ETH
- Can't be tampered with once deployed
<br>
Every transaction recorded on a blockchain is immutable and publicly accessible, allowing donors to track how their contributions are utilized in real-time. This transparency fosters trust between NGOs and their supporters, as donors can verify that funds are being allocated as promised.
